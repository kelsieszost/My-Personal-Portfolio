# My Project Portfolio

## This site is my technology portfolio to showcase my skillset as I continue to grow in my career. My motivation for this project was my desire to practice html/css to string together topics that I have been learning. My portfolio allows me a tool that can be added and subtracted to throughout my career. I learned that if you give it your all when you have been stuck on one issue in your code for 3 hours, if you keep trying, you will figure it out.
